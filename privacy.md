5.1. Ad network providers

Creator uses ad network providers, ad exchanges, and ad servers (“Advertising Partners”) to help present advertisements in our Games or run advertising campaigns on third party games and platforms. These Advertising Partners use certain technologies for presenting, better targeting, and measuring the effectiveness of their advertisements, using data gathered over time and across their networks of games to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audiences (“Advertising Data”).

If you are under 16 years old than you will not see any advertising including contextual advertising and Advertising Partners will not collect any Advertising Data from you.

If you are above 16 years old and opt-in to data sharing than Advertising Partners process the Data which includes but not limited to; your device identifiers, any information regarding in-app events (such as how often you use the app, for how long you use the app, the events that occur within the app, in-app purchases, aggregated usage), your device’s IP address, mobile advertising ID (IDFA / AdID).

Creator processes such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Our Advertising Partners may act as a data processor or data controller with regards to the Advertising Data, depending on the scope of their services. The Advertising Partners are responsible for their compliance with the applicable data protection legislation. The use of the advertising technologies by such third parties as ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy. The legal basis for the processing of the Advertising Data for targeted advertisements is consent. The legal basis for optimizing and tracking conversion rates of advertising campaigns that we run with others is legitimate interest.

5.2. Payment Service Providers

Creator may also use third-party payment service providers (“PSP”), offering payment transaction services to Creator in order to sell a product or service through our Games. The PSP acts a data controller with regards to the personal data related to the transactions (“transaction data”) processed for the purpose of purchasing the product or service. The transaction data may include your personal details, your payment card details, and the transaction details. Whenever you buy something in our Games (e.g., a virtual game item), the information that you provide to the PSP is subject to their privacy policies, not ours. The legal basis for this processing is the performance of a contract. You explicitly consent that Creator may provide personal information collected from you to a PSP for the purpose of the offering of the payment-transaction service whenever you buy something in our Games and that such PSP may use such data for (statistical) analysis of payment transactions. After you have purchased a product or service, Creator and the PSP have a legal requirement to retain your information for a legally determined period of at least 7 years. Creator shall be allowed to notify a PSP regarding a user that engages in (or who a party believes has engaged in) any activity that is illegal, that violates any person’s rights, or that led to such a user’s suspension or termination of use of the Games. Creator shall be allowed to notify a PSP regarding a user who engages in (or who a party believes has engaged in) any activity that is illegal, that violates any person’s rights, or that resulted in such user’s suspension or termination of use of a Game.
